This program is a virtual pet program that allows the user to interact with it.
The pet is a dog and the program allows the user to name it.
The dog have initial levels (variables) of hunger, thirst, tiredness and boredom assigned, and it changes depending how the user interacts with it.
After the user gives the dog a name, the program asks if the user wants to interact with the dog, if the answer is "Y" or "YES", the program gives the user options of what to do with the dog, if the answer is "N" the program ends.
When the user answer yes, the program give the dog status letting the user know if the dog is hungry, thirsty, tired or bored.
The program give the user 5 options of what to do with the dog: Feed the dog , give water to the dog, put the dog to sleep, play with the dog, or do nothing. The user must type a number between 1 and 5 correspondent to the answer he/she chooses. Then print to the screen what was done. It also updates the pet status if the user chooses the options between 1 and 4.
Since it uses a do while loop, it will keep asking if the user wants to interact with the dog until the user answers no to end the program.
